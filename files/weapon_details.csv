This sword can alternatively be obtained in Act One by disarming Voss via Command (Drop), Heat Metal, Disarming Attack (Ranged), or Honeyed Paws before entering the Mountain Pass X:-139Y:561. If received in Act 1, a second version of this weapon will not be given as a quest reward but can be looted if Voss is killed in Act 3. Voss must be disarmed before beginning the encounter, as he immediately flies away when any hostile action is taken and the party is locked into dialogue when approaching close enough. Due to his high stats, the chance of failing the disarm attempt against him is very high, so this method may require multiple reloads or extensive preparation. See: Guide: Early Silver Sword. Using Honeyed Paws while having a divination wizard with a 15 or higher portent die nearby allows you to guarantee that he drops his weapon. You can long rest until you get 15 or higher and make the bear invisible[note 1] so he can approach Voss. Sometimes Voss will only drop a Githyanki Crossbow, or the weapon he drops will simply phase out of existence. The triggers for these anomalies are not known. The sword can be acquired in Act Three before entering the Lower City during Deal with the Devil. If you don't sign the contract but lie to Voss, he will give you the sword (DC 30 Deception check).",https://bg3.wiki/w/images/thumb/8/8b/Githyanki_Greatsword_Icon.png/300px-Githyanki_Greatsword_Icon.png,MAG_GreaterSilver_Greatsword,f01c3f5d-c542-420f-86c5-bdddf7819e29
